# Nepali_Number_Plate_Recognition

There are tons of different number plate recognition projects in the internet. <br>
But due to the lack of clean and large datasets for Nepali Number plate recognition system, we are limited to some extent. However, giving it a go by collecting the best possible volume of images is always fun.

<i>I have used very basic Convolutions in my Neural Network and have tried my best to keep the code as simple as it could be like in my other codes.

The model's accuracy is somehow satisfactory😜, seems overfitted-that's probably because of the small dataset and sort of deep network. Please feel free to suggest the better ways. You can connect with me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bishabpokharel/">here.</a>
